**Agile**- An incremental and iterative software development methodology, which focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, flexibility, and incremental delivery of software in short cycles called **a sprint.**



**Scrum Framework-** Scrum is the most popular Agile framework. Each sprint usually lasts 2–4 weeks.



**Scrum Roles**

1. **Product Owner (PO)-** Provide the vision of the product to the team, manage the product Backlog and explain to the team to make better decisions and prioritize them to achieve the best.

Responsible for:

1. Managing Product Backlog

2\. Prioritizing features

3\. Defining requirements

4\. Accepting or rejecting work

PO represents **business.**



**2. Scrum Master(Scrum coach)-** Helps the team to adopt Scrum \& self-organized and follow the actual work in agile methodology. 

Responsible for:

1. Removing blockers

2\. Ensuring Scrum process is followed

3\. Facilitating meetings/scrum ceremonies

4\. Protecting the team from external interruptions

Scrum Master is a **facilitator**, not a manager.



**3. Team(Dev, Tester, etc)-** Self organized(what \& how to commit), cross functional(Analysis, dev, test, DB)and structured team. Usually, 7 to 10 members are accountable collectively.

Responsible for:

1. Development
2. Test
3. Deployment
4. Maintenance

As a whole, no blame game on a single person, but rather a team effort.



**4. QA(Quality Analyst)-** Process-related, focuses on building in quality, preventing defects, process-oriented, entire full cycle.

Responsible for:

1. Understanding requirements

2\. Writing test cases

3\. Performing functional \& regression testing

4\. Logging defects

5\. Participating in sprint planning

6\. Supporting UAT

QA ensures **quality** within the sprint.



**Sprint Cycle -** An Agile sprint is a short, consistent, time-boxed period—typically 2–4 weeks—during which a team works to complete a set amount of high-priority work and delivers a shippable product increment. 

Typical Sprint Flow: The following are the Scrum ceremonies followed in agile methodology.

1. Sprint Planning
2. Daily Standups
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retrospective



| **Scrum Event                      | Participants                                          | When Conducted                      | Purpose**                                                                                                                                       |

| **\*\*Sprint Planning\*\***              | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner         | Before the start of each sprint     | 1. Prioritize Product Backlog items

&nbsp;																 | 2. Forecast how much work can be completed in the sprint 

&nbsp;																 | 3. Select items to form the Sprint Backlog 

| **\*\*Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)\*\*** | Development Team, Scrum Master (PO optional)          | Daily (usually 15 minutes)          | 1. What did I complete yesterday?

&nbsp;																 | 2. What will I work on today?

&nbsp;																 | 3. Any blockers or impediments?                                         

| **\*\*Sprint Review\*\***                | Dev Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, Stakeholders   | At the end of each sprint           | 1. Demonstrate completed work (Sprint Increment)

&nbsp;																 | 2. Collect stakeholder feedback

&nbsp;																 | 3. Discuss improvements or backlog adjustments         

| **\*\*Sprint Retrospective\*\***         | Development Team, Scrum Master, Product Owner         | After Sprint Review (end of sprint) | 1. Reflect on team performance

&nbsp;																 | 2. What went well / What didn’t go well

&nbsp;																 | 3. Identify improvement actions for the next sprint    



In Sprint Planning, I clarify acceptance criteria and estimate testing effort.



In Daily Stand-up, I update on testing progress and blockers.



In Sprint Review, I confirm tested features and highlight quality status.



In Retrospective, I suggest process improvements (test coverage, automation, defect leakage reduction).
